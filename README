Basic Installation
==================

To install the TWB, the shell commands 
`./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.

The install script will install the TWB libraries in your ocaml
directory, and few example scripts in the directory /usr/bin.

You can specify a different installation path via the option
--prefix . However notice that in this case you must set the 
environment variable OCAMLPATH (used by the findlib library) to
locate the directory where the TWB libraries are installed.
